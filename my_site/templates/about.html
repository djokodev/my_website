      Orientation isn't always easy in our African families, so I did my
      secondary education in a technical high school, specializing in f5
      (refrigeration and air conditioning), yes I know it sounds a bit weird üòÖ.
      When I was a senior in high school, I fell in love with technology, and
      that's when I discovered the data professions. Since then, I've had just
      one goal: to become a Deep Learning Engineer.

      I encountered a lot of problems at the outset, particularly concerning my
      predispositions for a career in this field. Coming from a very remote
      background, the question was whether I would succeed on this axis! But as
      Steve Jobs says
      <span class="citation"
        >"Your work will occupy a large part of your life, and the only way to
        be truly satisfied is to do what you think is a great job. And the only
        way to do a great job is to love what you do"</span

      and so üòâ

    Today I've got my "brevet de technicien sup√©rieur" (BTS) in software
    engineering, and to get closer to my goal I decided to start with web
    development, and what better way than with the programming language python,
    since today it's a reference in fields such as artificial intelligence,
    machine learning and deep learning.
  </p>
  <p>
    I've been a fullstack python developer for over a year now, and use
    technologies such as Django, React, Git, Html, Css and Bootstrap on a daily
    basis. And when it comes to artificial intelligence, I currently hold more
    than three certifications in areas such as data science, machine learning
    and deep learning. I develop and deploy artificial intelligence solutions
    such as computer vision, speech recognition and many others.
